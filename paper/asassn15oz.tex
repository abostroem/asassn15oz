\begin{abstract}
\end{abstract}
Single, hydrogen-rich, core collapse supernovae typically divided into three classes: IIP, with a 100 day plateau following maximum light, IIL, showing a linearly declining light curve following maximum light, and IIn which show narrow emission lines in their spectra. These classification are indicative of the characteristics of the late stage evolution of the hydrogen envelope of the progenitor star. The plateau is explained by recombination through a thick envelope, the linear decline with recombination through a thinner envelope, and IIn with strong interaction with circumstellar material lost prior to explosion. For this reason, we generally do not consider interaction when modeling IIP and IIL supernovae. However, recent hydrodynamic modeling of IIP and IIL supernovae has been unable to reproduce the early (~30 days post explosion) light curve without the introduction of circumstellar material. One explanation for the smaller hydrogen envelope in IIL supernovae is mass loss, which would lead to circumstellar material. This makes IIL supernovae ideal for understanding whether IIP and IIL supernovae experience interaction. We test this hypothesis on ASAS-SN15oz, a type IIL supernova and the closest type II supernova in 2015. With extensive follow-up in the x-ray, UV, optical, IR, and radio we search for signs of interaction. Interestingly, we find evidence of interaction in the radio and optical, but only upper limits in the X-ray and UV, leading to questions about universality of these indicators.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% INTRODUCTION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Introduction}
We know that massive stars that retain at least partially the hydrogen layer at the moment of the explosions ends their life as SNe II. 
However we are still missing a complete picture to explain they diversity in luminosity (5 orders of magnitudes at maximum), the diversity in the light curve shape (linear vs plateau). 
In the lat few years the organization of type II in two classes IIP and IIl has been also questioned. 
With few authors supporting a clear separation and other supporting a continuum class that includes IIP and IIL. 
In addition it has always been hard to reproduce with hydrodynamic calculation the lsteep decline visible in SNe IIL-like objects. 
Recently there have bee more and more evidences of the presence of some interaction in the early phase of SNe II and in particular in SNe IIL. 
Morozova was recently able to reproduce those light curve with an extended envelope with which the SN interact soon after the explosion. 
Evidence of some material left before the explosion have been also found with the presence of narrow lines in the first spectra few hours to days after the explosion. 

Here we present the study of ASASSN-15oz a type IIl-like SN for which we were able to collect an extended set of data from the X-ray to the radio. 
We will use these data to investigate the presence of interaction ?.

In the next section we will ...

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SN PARAMETERS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Supernova Parameters} \label{15ozIntro}
Supernova ASAS-SN15oz was discovered by the ASAS-SN team on August 31, 2015 and announced on September 3, 2015 \citep{2016brown}. 
The next day Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) classified it as a type II supernova one week after explosion \citep{2016hosseinzadeh}. 
\Azalee{Define distance modulus}

Imaging of HIPASS J1919-33 from August 23, 2015 does not show any evidence of ASAS-SN15oz (V $>$ 17.8). 
We take this to be a lower limit on the explosion epoch. 
It is therefore reasonable to take as the mid-point between the non-detection and the detection as explosion date with the $1\sigma$ error being the time to the non-detection: $t_{expl} =$ 2015-08-27 $\pm 4$ days.

\citet{2017gutierrez} found that the explosion epoch can be determined, with an average errors of 4.9 days, by fitting the blue part of the first spectrum with SNID \citep{2011blondin} and using the explosion epoch of the best fit template.
This method relies on the existence of a template supernova that is similar in both phase and type to the object being fit.
ASAS-SN15oz is a type IIL supernova and our first spectrum is from around maximum. 
SNID has very few templates for type IIL supernovae, we therefore add templates for two well observed supernovae with well constrained explosion epochs: 2012A and 2013ej.
\Azalee{make templates publicly available and link to them}
We confirm our explosion epoch by fitting the first spectrum (2015-09-04) using SNID v. 5.0, augmenting the templates with those of \citet{2017gutierrez}, SN2012A \citep{2013tomasella}, and SN2013ej \citep{2016childress,2016dhungana,2014valentiB,2015smartt}.
The five best fit spectra imply an explosion epoch of  2015-08-22, consistent with the range we propose based on non-detections.
interestingly, the hydrodynamic light curve modeling also places the best fit explosion epoch on the day of the last non-detection (see Section \ref{LC}).

We use an X-shooter spectrum taken with the UVB and VIS arms to constrain the host galaxy reddening to confirm the galactic reddening using the equivalent widths of the Na I D1 and D2 lines ($\lambda$5890, $\lambda$5896) \citep{2012poznanski}. 
We find no evidence of Na I absorption at the host redshift and therefore assume no host absorption. 
By fitting gaussian profiles to the galactic Na I absorption we find E(B-V) = 0.12, consistent with the value given by \citet{2011schlafly}. 
We adopt the \citet{2011schlafly}  value of 0.08 for the analysis in this paper. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% OBSERVATIONS and DATA REDUCTION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Observations and Data Reduction}
\Azalee{Look into how people talk about telescopes vs collaborations vs instruments}
ASAS-SN15oz was the closest type II supernova of 2015 and was observed extensively at all wavelengths. 
The majority of our observations were provided by the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) Supernova Key Project (2014-2017) and the Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey for Transients (PESSTO). 
We supplemented these observations with dedicated projects in the X-ray and UV with \textit{Swift} (1114241, PI: Valenti) and in the radio with the VLA (VLA/15B-362, PI: Valenti). 
The photometric and spectroscopic data reduction are defined in the next sections. 
A complete list of photometric observations is given in Table \ref{tab:LcObs}.  
Spectroscopic observations are detailed in Table \ref{tab:SpecObs}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\subsection{Optical}
The optical light curve was closely monitored by the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) from discovery through day 400 in the filters B, V, g, r, and i. 
Unfortunately, the supernova passed behind the sun around day 80, leaving a gap in the observations from day 86 to day 184, most notably missing the fall from plateau.
Figure \ref{fig:LC} shows the complete light curve.
LCO observations were reduced with the LCO imaging pipeline, lcogtsnpipe \ref{2016valenti}. 
This pipeline employs PSF photometry, removing background contamination by fitting a low order polynomial to the host galaxy.
Instrument magnitudes are converted to absolute magnitudes using the APASS system \footnote{https://www.aavso.org/apass} converting B and V to the Landolt magnitude system (Vega magnitudes) and g, r, and i to the sloan magnitude system (AB magnitudes). 


Extensive optical spectroscopy was obtained during the photospheric phase with the FLOYDS spectrograph on the 2m LCO telescope at Siding Springs, Australia as part of the LCO Supernova Key Project and the EFOSC2 spectrograph on the 3.6 m NTT telescope at La Silla, Chile as part of the PESSTO Project. 
The PESSTO project also contributed late time nebular spectra were observed on the NTT telescope. 
One-dimensional spectra were extracted and calibrated using the FLOYDS \citep{2014valenti} and EFOSC pipelines, which string together standard IRAF extraction tasks \Stefano{What is the right way to cite this?}. 
Figure \ref{fig:SpecAll} shows the evolution of the spectra over time, starting from a blue spectrum with broad hydrogen lines and developing metal features such as iron and scandium as the velocities decrease and the line widths narrow. 
More unusually, the cachito feature \citep{2017gutierrez}, blueward of the H-$\alpha$ absorption is present in the first spectrum, growing in strength through day 20 (2015-09-16) and then decreasing in strength at later times. \Azalee{Say more here or reference future section for interpretation} \Stefano{Is this too much interpretation for this section?}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\subsection{UV and X-Ray Observations}\label{SecSwift}
UV and X-Ray imaging observations were obtained concurrently with \textit{Swift} programs 1114241 and XXXXXXX through 2015-11-18.
In addition to the imaging observations, two epochs of \textit{Swift} grism observations were taken under program 1114241. \Stefano{is this too repetitive with the intro to the observations section}.
Imaging observations were processed with aperture photometry following \citet{2009brown} employing the updated zeropoints of \citet{2010breeveld}.
UV grism observations were taken at two roll angles and extracted using the UVOTPY pipeline \citep{2014kuin}. 
There is a nearby star coincident with the supernova at one roll angle and just above it at another roll angle.
Although we tried custom extractions using different extraction box height and TRUVOT \citep{2015smitka} we were unable to produce a better calibration than the default pipeline. 
Although two epoch were taken, only the first one has sufficient S/N to be extracted. 

An upper limit in the X-ray was determined using aperture photometry .
An 18" aperture was used to integrate around the location of ASAS-SN15oz. 
The background was removed using an aperture in a blank part of the image and measured fluxes were converted from counts to luminosity assuming a power-law model with a photon index of two.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% LIGHT CURVE EVOLUTION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Light Curve Evolution} \label{LC}
The light curve of all type IIP/IIL supernovae show an initial rise, followed by a period of 100 days during which the supernova stays the same brightness or declines linearly. 
During this time the light curve is powered by the radioactive decay of ${}^{56}$Ni and the expansion of the ejecta approximately balances the receding Hydrogen recombination front, leading to a close to constant photospheric radius. 
About 100 days after explosion, the recombination front passes the inner edge of the hydrogen envelope causing a sudden drop in luminosity referred to as the fall from plateau.  
After the fall from plateau, light curve declines linearly, following the ${}^{56}$Co decay.

The light curve of ASAS-SN15oz shows a linear decline similar to that of other type IIL SNe. 
The light curve reaches peak brightness in the V-band 8.25 days after explosion, one day after observations began, reaching an above average absolute magnitude of -18.05 +/- 0.025.
The early light curve rises until around day 20 in the redder filters, flattening in the V-band and falling in the blue bands during this same period. 
The light curve then falls in all bands for the remainder of the observations, changing slope around day 40 and again sometime after day 85, following the fall from plateau. 
Following \citep{2014Anderson}, we fit a slope to the first steep initial decline after maximum ($s_1$) and to the second shallower slope prior to the fall from plateau ($s_2$). 
We also fit a global decline rate, $s_{50v}$ from soon after maximum to prior to the fall from plateau.
During the nebular phase we fit a slope to the radioactive decay tail ($s_{tail}$). 
The slopes we fit as well as the details of the fit are summarized in table \ref{tab:slope} and compared with other objects in Section \ref{SecComp}.
\Azalee{significant figures?}
%=======================
\input{slopes}  \label{tab:slope}%created by lightcurve_characteristics.ipynb
%-----------------------------------------
The slope of the radioactive decay tail is steeper than a pure ${}^{56}Co$ decay implying that the hydrogen envelop is not fully trapping and reprocessing the gamma rays produced by the radioactive decay.

The Pseudo-bolometric luminosity is computed following \citet{2008valenti}.
Each apparent magnitude is corrected for galactic extinction (see Section \ref{15ozIntro}).
The flux density is calculated from the apparent magnitude at the effective wavelength of the filter and integrated using Simpson's Rule. 
Finally, the flux is converted to a luminosity using the distance modulus (Section \ref{15ozIntro}). 
We use  the U, B, g, V, r, R, i, I to calculate the bolometric luminosity at the V-band cadence.
When V-band observations extended either earlier or later than a filter, we use the color with the neighboring filter to extrapolate the flux.

Initial line identification was performed by comparing the spectra to that of supernova 1999em \citep{2001leonard}.

The results of the Syn++ fit can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:syn++}.
The top plot shows the combined fit, while the contributions from the individual elements are shown in the subsequent plots below.
Syn++ models pure resonance scattering which is a good approximation for all lines modeled except H-$\alpha$. 
For this reason we use the H-$\beta$ line to determine the hydrogen contribution to the fit. 
A separate fit to H-$\alpha$ is shown in the second plot of Figure \ref{fig:syn++} and the parameters are detailed in the H-$\alpha$ row of Table \ref{tab:syn++}.

%-----------------------------------------

We find the velocity of lines for which individual components can be resolved using two methods with the goal of making the velocity measurements robust to small deviations in the input parameters. 
For lines that are not blended or that are dominated by the absorption of one ion (Scandium features ($\lambda$ 5526, 5662, 6262)), we employ the method presented in \citet{2012silverman}. 
Briefly, the continuum is a straight line through the edges of a blended feature, defined by a concave down quadratic fit to the region where the slope changed. 
The velocity is then defined as the minimum of cubic spline fit  to the continuum subtracted flux (see \ref{AppLineFit} for more details).
Rather than expressing an uncertainty on the fit, we calculate the uncertainty in the velocity as the range of velocities that encompass 68.2\% of the integrated (continuum subtracted) flux around the feature minimum.
Since each single line is formed in an extended region of the ejecta, this represents the range of velocities at which each line forms.

For lines that are blended (but still showed isolated absorption troughs for some features) we define the continuum as a straight line from the lowest side of the feature. 
After dividing by the continuum, we then simultaneously fit multiple 1D Gaussian profiles to the continuum normalized spectra. 
For blended features originating in the same part of the ejecta, we require that each component has the same width.
%requiring that each component has the same width.
We define the velocity of a feature as the minimum of the individual Gaussian profile corresponding to that ion and the error as the standard deviation of the fit. 
For the Ca II NIR triplet we use the additional constraint of a fixed offset between the minima of the features. 
We use this method to fit H-$\alpha$ ($\lambda$ 6561), O I ($\lambda$ 7774), FeII ($\lambda$ 5169), and Ca II ($\lambda\lambda\lambda$ 8498, 8542, 8662). 

We use both methods to fit Na I ($\lambda$ 5898) and H-$\beta$ ($\lambda$4861). 
For Na I, we find the spline fit does not characterize the minimum of the profile well and instead use the Gaussian minimum. 
The H-$\beta$ profile is contaminated by another feature (possibly Ti II) at later times, offsetting the minimum found using the spline fit. 
For this reason we prefer the Gaussian fit for H-$\beta$ as well. 
A comparison of the results of both fits for H-$\beta$ at early times finds them in good agreement, giving us confidence in the consistency of the two methods.

Figure \ref{fig:velocity} shows the velocities for all good fits to the data. 
The distribution of velocities is typical of other IIP/IIL supernovae representing the distribution of elements throughout the ejecta. 
A comparison of the velocities derived in this paper to the average values of 122 IIP/IIL SNe described in \citet{2017gutierrez} is shown in Figure \ref{fig:VelocityCompare}. The shaded regions represent the standard deviation of the sample.
We find throughout the ejecta above average velocities, consistent with a larger than average explosion energy \Stefano{and mass?}. 
This is consistent with the light curve modeling (see Section \ref{sec:LCmodel})

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EVIDENCE FOR INTERACTION%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Introductory words here...
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{UV and X-Ray}
From the \textit{Swift} X-Ray observations, we find a limiting count rate of  7.234x10$^{-4}$ counts s$^{-1}$.
Assuming Galactic absorption of 6.18x$10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ \citep{2005kalberla}, this corresponds to an unabsorbed flux of 2.208x10$^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ (0.4-5 keV) and a luminosity of approximately 3.72x10$^{39}$erg s$^{-1}$ at 30 Mpc.

The \textit{Swift} grism observations show no sign of the narrow emission lines typically associated with strong interaction.
This is supported by a lack of UV continuum excess at any epoch. 
%UV spectrum presented in this paper are average of the first epoch weighted by the error.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% LIGHT CURVE MODELING%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Light Curve Modeling with SNEC}
We fit the light curve of ASAS-SN15oz using the Supernova Explosion Code (SNEC) \citep{2015morozova}.
SNEC is an open source Lagrangian 1D radiation hydrodynamic code that assumes local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).
Type II supernovae are well characterized by LTE from shock breakout through the fall from plateau. 
SNEC uses a Paczy\'nski equation of state \citep{1983paczynski} solving for the ionization fractions using the Saha equations in the non-degenerate approximation \citep{2000zaghloul}. 
Opacities are drawn from OPAL Type II opacity tables \citep{1996iglesias} at high temperature ($T=10^{4.5}-10^{8.7}$) and tables of \citet{2005ferguson} at low temperatures ($T = 10^{2.7}-10^{4.5}K$) supplemented with an opacity floor of 0.01 cm$^2$g$^{-1}$. 
The progenitor of ASAS-SN15oz is modeled using a non-rotating solar-metalicity Red Supergiant of mass M, evolved with the {\it Kepler} code \citep{2016sukhbold}. 
\Azalee{more citations?}. 
Mixing of layers due to the explosion is modeled by boxcar smoothing the progenitor profile with a kernel of 0.4 \msunperiod.
\Azalee{What does Kepler do with mass lost to stellar winds? Is it in the profile?}
To account for the formation of the neutron star, we excise the region interior to the Si/O interface \citep{2018morozova}. 

We explore variations in circumstellar material due to mass-loss by adding a steady-state wind above the RSG models with density profile:
\begin{equation}
\rho(r) = \frac{\dot{M}}{4\pi r^{2}v_{wind}} = \frac{K}{r^{2}}
\end{equation}
where $\dot{M}$ is the wind mass-loss rate, $v_{wind}$ is the wind velocity. 
This approximation allows us to parameterize the CSM with two parameters, K and $R_{ext}$, the radial extent of the CSM.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{SNEC modeling of ASAS-SN15oz}\label{sec:LCmodeling}
We model the explosion of ASAS-SN15oz using a thermal bomb with explosion energy $E_{exp}$ lasting for 1 second in the inner 0.02 \msunperiod. 
\Viktoriya{Inner 0.02 Msun before or after the excision of the neutron star?}
\Azalee{sort out explosion energy}

SNEC does not model nuclear reaction networks, but rather takes an input a mass of ${}^{56}$Ni. 
Given the uncertainty in the mass of ${}^{56}$Ni produced by ASAS-SN15oz we produced models for the maximum, minimum, and mean value of synthesized ${}^{56}$Ni (see Section \label{SecNi}).
While SNEC allows for the ${}^{56}$Ni to be mixed out to different interior radii, \Viktoriya{Is this true? It seems like you get different results in the 2018 paper} find that the light curve is not very sensitive to the mixing fraction and thus we choose to keep this value fixed at 5.0 R$_{\odot}$. 
Following \citet{2017morozova}, we explore different mass-loss scenarios by adding a constant wind density profile to RSG density profile with density K and radial extent (from the center) R.

We use SNEC to find the best progenitor parameters varying the progenitor mass, explosion energy, ${}^{56}$Ni mass, CSM density, and CSM extent. 
Table \ref{tb:param} gives the set of parameters used, resulting in over 5000 model light curves.

For ease of comparison with observations, SNEC uses the temperature at each time step to compute a blackbody spectrum, which it combines with different filter throughputs to output a light curve in sloan filters u, g, r, and i, Bessel filters U, B, V, R, and I and PanSTARRs filter z. 
During the rise and plateau phase, a blackbody should be a good approximation to the longer wavelengths. 
However, line blanketing make cause the bluer filters to be a poor representation of the observed spectrum \citep{2009kasen}.
For this reason the best fit model is determined using the g, r, and i filter. 
While we do have a V band light curve, the throughput heavily overlaps with the g and r bands and its inclusion would give more weight to these wavelengths without providing new information.
The best fit model is determined by interpolating the well sampled model to the observed wavelengths and computing a chi-square minimization across all three filters.
Given the uncertainty in the explosion time, we shift the model spectrum by $\pm$4 days and treat this offset as a free parameter.
We find the light curve of ASAS-SN15oz is best characterized by M = 18 \msunperiod, E = 1.4x10$^{51}$ ergs, K = 10 g/cm, R = 2400 \rsun, mass$_{Ni}$ = 0.083, t$_{offset}$ = -4 days.
This model is shown with and without CSM interaction in Figure \ref{fig:LC}.

We expect the blue filters to be affected by line blanketing and attribute the overestimate of the model flux in the g-band to this effect.}

\subsection{Mass-loss}
There is broad degeneracy in the CSM parameters, making this analysis a better estimate of the total mass loss rather than the mass-loss history. 
Integrating the CSM density over it radial extent, we find a total mass loss of 0.62 \msunperiod. 

\citet{2018morozova} find the best fit model with and without CSM as a two step process. 
First they modeling the second half of the light curve, characterized by the S2 slope \Azalee{citation} without CSM to determine the best progenitor mass and explosion energy. 
Then, fixing explosion energy and progenitor mass, they explore the CSM parameter space. 
This is computationally less intensive than modeling the full parameter space and allows them to explore a finer grid of parameters.
Given the complexity of the parameter space, we choose to model the best light curve with CSM, exploring the full set of parameters. 
To compare our best fit model to that without CSM, we use the best fit progenitor mass and explosion energy. 
This should be a good representation of the best fit model as we expect the light curve to be the same during the S2 slope and improved by CSM at early times during the S1 slope.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Comparison of Observed and Modeled Ejecta Velocity}
To check the consistency of our photospheric modeling, we compare the photospheric velocity of the best fit SNEC model to the observed photospheric velocity of ASAS-SN15oz (see Figure \ref{fig:SNECVelocityCompare}.
Following \citet{2014faran}, we define the photospheric velocity as that of Fe II $\lambda$5169. 
We use the relationship between the $H-\beta$ velocity and the Fe II $\lambda$5169 velocity defined in \citet{2014faran} to infer the photospheric velocity at early times when the iron line is not yet visible.
While there is fair agreement between the model and observe velocity at early times, the model velocity is significantly lower than the observed velocity starting around day 25.
This behavior was previously noted by \citet{2018paxton} who find that the Fe II $\lambda$5169 line is originating above the photosphere where the Sobolov optical depth is a specific value (they find $\tau_{sob} \sim1$ fits the observations well). 
This effect becomes significant as the photosphere begins to recede around 20-30 days exactly when we see a deviation between our model and observed velocities. 
\Azalee{decide whether to implement this or leave it as an explanation}

The model deviated from the observations around the time that the photosphere begins to recede into the ejecta.
This discrepancy is likely the result of the Fe II line being produced above the ejecta at these times \citep{2018paxton}.

\subsection{Determining the Nickel Mass}\label{SecNi}
Following \citet{2016valenti} we find the Nickel mass synthesized in a supernova explosion by scaling the bolometric luminosity of ASAS-Sn15oz when it is powered by ${}^{56}Co$ to that of supernova 1987A using the following relation:
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:Ni}
M({}^{56}Ni) = 0.075M_{\odot} \times \frac{L_{sn}(t)}{L_{87A}(t)}
\end{equation}
\Stefano{does this need a reference?}
This method assumes that either the slope of the radioactive decay tail follows that of SN1987A (i.e. complete gamma ray trapping) or that the bolometric luminosity immediately after the fall from plateau is known. 
Since neither of these is true for ASAS-SN15oz we consider the maximum and minimum Nickel mass allowed by the observations. 
An upper limit on the Nickel mass can be obtains if ASAS-SN15oz fell from plateau immediately after our last photospheric point.
For this case, we construct an artificial fall from plateau starting at the last photospheric point and using the median fall from plateau slope ($w0 = -0.087$) from the 30 IIp/IIL supernovae in \citet{2016valenti}.
A Nickel mass of $0.1 M_{\odot}$ is found using the bolometric luminosity at 86 days, the intersection of the fall from plateau and the extrapolated radioactive tail.
To find a lower limit on the total Nickel mass we estimate the maximum plateau length using Figure 5a in \citet{2016valenti}. 
Given the slope of ASAS-SN15oz ($s_{50V} = 1.09 mag/50$ days), the maximum time to the end of the fall from plateau is 135 days$t_{pt} =130$ days and the maximum phase at the end of the fall from plateau to be 135 days.
Extrapolating the bolometric luminosity of the radioactive decay tail slope to this time and using equation \ref{eqn:Ni}, we find a lower limit on the Nickel mass of 0.08 $M_{\odot}$.
Finally, we consider an intermediate Nickel mass, the mean of the upper and lower limits, 0.11 $M_{\odot}$.

\subsection{Progenitor Mass from Nebular Spectra}
Nebular observations, taken 200-500 days post-explosion when the eject is transparent, show no continuum and strong emission lines. 
The flux of these lines is used to determine the mass of each element present in the ejecta.
The mass of each element is directly related to the mass of the progenitor star. 
Specifically, simulations of supernovae explosions, show that the oxygen mass monotonically increases with progenitor mass \citep{2007woosley}.
Consequently, the [OI] flux ($\lambda\lambda6300, 6334$) can be measured and mapped to progenitor mass using spectral synthesis codes.

We compare the nebular spectra of ASAS-SN15oz, observed between April 11, 2016 and September 19, 2016 (227 - 388 days post explosion) to the models presented in \citet{2014jerkstrand} for 12, 15, 19, and 25 M$_{\odot}$ progenitors (MZAMS).
Starting with the explosion models from \citet{2007woosley}, the ejecta is divided into zones based on chemical composition and the evolution of the spectrum is found by modeling the gamma ray transport and deposition, non-thermal electron degradation, NLTE ionization and excitation, and Monte Carlo radiative transfer.
Figure \ref{fig:neb} shows the August 3, 2016 observation and the models, scaled to the observations over the full wavelength range.
\Azalee{Figure out scaling and write about findings}
The [OI] lines are displayed in the inset figure. 
We find the [OI] strength falls between the 15 and 19 M$_\odot$ models consistent with the 18 M$_{\odot}$ found by modeling the light curve.

Most features in the observed spectrum well matched by the models. 
The inset shows the [O I] ($\lambda\lambda6300, 6334$) feature which increases monotonically with progenitor mass. 
The [O I] flux falls between the 15 and 19 M$_{\odot}$ models pointing to a progenitor in this mass range. 
This is consistent with the results of the light curve modeling which found an 18 M$_{\odot}$ progenitor.}

\section{Discussion: Comparison to other objects} \label{SecComp}
To find objects with a similar light curve to ASAS-SN15oz we compare the $s_{50V}$ slope to that of other supernovae \Stefano{how should we describe the database?}.
SN 2016zb and SN 2015W have the best matched slopes. We compare the multi-band light curves and spectra of these objects and find them to be very similar in all respects.

\Azalee{Revisit this figure. Is V-band the right one to measure both of these? how complete is the database? Consider cutting those with too large slopes}

\section{Line Fitting Details}\label{AppLineFit}
We eliminate large noise spikes (e.g. from cosmic rays) using a Savitzky-Golay smoothing filter \citep{1964savitzky} with a quadratic function over a binsize of 5 pixels. 
For each line, a minimum and maximum wavelength is defined as well as a slope to account for the shifting of the feature over time as the ejecta slows. 
A slope is then fit to small bins over this wavelength range, starting with a binsize of 5 pixels and increasing until exactly 3 changes in slope are found (at either edge of the line and the line center). 
If the binsize reaches 40\% of the feature size, no further attempt at fitting is made. 
The feature edges are confirmed by fitting a quadratic function to the region centered on each edge identified by the slope change with a width of 20 pixels for the FLOYDS spectra and 5 pixels for the EFOSC spectra. 
The edge is considered successfully found if the quadratic fit is concave down. 
The continuum is defined by a line though these end points.
Finally, the velocity is found by fitting a cubic spline to the continuum subtracted flux between the edges using the flux errors as weights.

The continuum edges are marked with a red circle and the red dashed line connecting these points is used as the continuum. 
The Ca II NIR triplet fit is found by simultaneously fitting 3 Gaussians with the same standard deviation and mean offsets corresponding to the expected wavelength separation of the triplet. 
The individual Gaussians are plotting at black dotted lines and the combined fit is plotted as a solid black line. 
The minima of the individual Gaussians is used to find the velocity of each component.
The Sc II feature is fit with a cubic spliine. 
The minimum of the spline is used to find the Sc II velocity.
